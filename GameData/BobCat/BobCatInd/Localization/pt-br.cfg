		#BOB-sci-xray-default = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.
		#BOB-sci-xray-KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.

		#BOB-sci-xray-KerbinInSpace = It's very... round. 
		#BOB-sci-xray-KerbinInSpace = Crew reporting in, from space!
		#BOB-sci-xray-MunInSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.

		#BOB-sci-xray-MinmusInSpace = The lake beds seem relatively flat, perhaps we could land there.
		#BOB-sci-xray-MinmusInSpace = Looking at the surface of Minmus reminds you of a favorite childhood dessert. You are tempted to taste the surface...

		#BOB-sci-xray-MohoInSpace = The planet doesn't appear to have an atmosphere, and you notice darker spots across the surface.
		#BOB-sci-xray-EveInSpace = You can't help but notice how incredibly purple the planet is. The shiny oceans are mesmerizing.
		#BOB-sci-xray-DunaInSpace = The planet is very red, and appears to have deep brown furrows across the surface. There does appear to be some kind of ice at both poles though.
		#BOB-sci-xray-IkeInSpace = You can't help but like Ike.
		#BOB-sci-xray-IkeInSpace = There appears to be some steep rocky slopes. The higher areas are lighter in color and the lowlands appear to be very dark gray.

		#BOB-sci-xray-DresInSpace = The surface has a patchwork of white and brown areas, with a few craters.
		#BOB-sci-xray-JoolInSpace = You watch the flowing green storms below, they seem to go on forever endlessly swirling into eachother.
		#BOB-sci-xray-JoolInSpace = This planet is a wholesome green color, you note down that more planets should be this color.
		#BOB-sci-xray-LaytheInSpace = Laythe looks a lot like Kerbin, you wonder what would happen if you took your helmet off down there.
		#BOB-sci-xray-LaytheInSpace = The surface is mostly covered in oceans. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
		#BOB-sci-xray-VallInSpace = The surface has many impressive and jagged mountain ranges. You don't think you'd like to try and land on them.
		#BOB-sci-xray-VallInSpace = The moon is mostly white and lighter blue shades. It looks very cold and possibly frozen.
		#BOB-sci-xray-TyloInSpace = It looks like it would be very hard to land here. It also appears one side is more cratered then the other.
		#BOB-sci-xray-TyloInSpace = The surface is covered with various shades of white and gray. You think for a second you saw a face down there..
		#BOB-sci-xray-BopInSpace = It appears to be a large brown rock. Perhaps an old asteroid?
		#BOB-sci-xray-BopInSpace = As you stare at the planet, something flits by the window.. Is there something moving down there?
		#BOB-sci-xray-PolInSpace = It looks like a really large grain of pollen. You note down -Pol- in your report.
		#BOB-sci-xray-PolInSpace = The terrain below looks very hazardous. You make note of the jagged rocks, inclines and other dangerous areas.
		#BOB-sci-xray-EelooInSpace = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		#BOB-sci-xray-EelooInSpace = You search the sky for other nearby planets, you think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
